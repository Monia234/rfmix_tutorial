Using RFMix version 1.54.

Before running through the `.ipynb` tutorial, please check the following:
	* I have provided two RFMix binaries in the folder `binaries/` (for MacOS and Linux). Please move the appropriate one to the `PopPhased/` folder prior to running the tutorial.
	* Please ensure you have `python2.7`.
	* Please unzip `tutorial_data.zip`.

On the off-chance that you can't run the executables or are otherwise having trouble, please move the `outputPopPhased*` files out of the `example_output/` folder and into the same folder as the notebook. This way you should at least be able to visualize the local ancestry inference classification. You can also see the logfile of my RFMix run in this folder. (`logfile_asw_rfprobs`)`
